### Steps to Run the App
- Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/anaghajp1996/FetchRecipes.git
- Open the .xcodeproj with Xcode
- Select a simulator or connected device, and click the Run button in Xcode to launch the app.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I prioritised speed for this project, and hence:
 - The UI elements are quite simple. I would ideally add buttons for links within the RecipeC ard, or add another detail view with a larger image view, and all the available links with icons.
 - I would also write more test cases, for example, I would add more cases of malformed data.


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I roughly spent about 6 to 7 hours on this project. 
A breakdown:
- 30 minutes going through the requirements and planning the project.
- About 1-1.5 hours in setting up the core functionality to fetch data and converting it.
- 2 hours to set up the UI.
- The rest of my time was spent on testing and cleaning up the code.
- I spent an hour in the end making a couple of UI enhancements. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
- UI Complexity vs. Delivery Time: I opted for a basic and simple UI design to ensure timely delivery, focusing on functionality over aesthetics.
- Testing Coverage: Limited test coverage due to time constraints, prioritizing basic test cases for just core functionalities.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- I think the weakest part of the project is with error handling. Ideally I would customise error messages and have different UI elements for different error states. 
Example: I would design a different screen for when the device isn't connected to a network. 
- I also think the unit tests for this project is a weak spot. I would add better coverage. My tests only cover basic cases. 

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
- The deployment version is set to iOS 17. 
- The project also follows the MVVM architecture for simplicity.
